Files for Lab 1 Added screenshot for module 2

Five main components of an Information systems are Database, computer hardware, Software, tellecommunications and Human procedures.

Microsoft Access is an example of a database. An example of computer hardware is a Motherboard which houses major components that make the computer function. An example of computer software is IOS , an operating system for iPhones. An example of Tellecommunications is the Internet. An example of human procedures would be using the computer to send an email

A client server architecture is a system where a Main server provides data for a network of computers or devices. Github fits this model since many people can work on a project or code together.

Cloud computing is a form of storage where all data is stored in a single data center. An example of Cloud computing is "Google Cloud" which securely stores the data of many users.

In this Lab, I have learned many things about how computer systems and networks operate, I am looking forward to learning more about these topics since I find Client-servers very interesting. While completing this lab, it took me a while to figure out how to use Github , but I figured everything out pretty quickly!
